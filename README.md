# Virtual-Sanctuary
Imagine of animal lovers living in village area or far away from a Wildlife Sanctuary , National Parks and Zoological Parks. They have to spend a lot of time to travel to distant places to observe and cherish the beauty of mother earth. In addition during the lockdown almost each and every animal lover must be missing his/her periodic visits to these epic places where they observe the diversity and beautiful creations of god. During lockdown several Zoological parks and similar places have faced a huge loss because of lack of visitors to these places. In order to solve all these problem  I have made an app called “Virtual Sanctuary” which not only brings out the beauty of wildlife but also motivates people to visit such places to experience a great joy. Virtual Sanctuary is an Augmented Reality based app that projects a 3D model of a National Park/ Wildlife Sanctuary in the real world where one can see the animals and can experience same joy as they experience in such real places. This app is basically designed to ignite the fire within people to visit such places in order to save these and respect each and every organism living on this planet as we all are dependent on each other.
